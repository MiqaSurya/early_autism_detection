## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Validate Environment
```bash
node scripts/validate-production-env.js
```

### 2. Build and Test Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Test critical functionality
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment
1. Push to main branch
2. Vercel automatically deploys
3. Monitor deployment logs

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] **Functionality Tests**
  - [ ] User registration and login works
  - [ ] M-CHAT-R assessment completes successfully
  - [ ] Autism center locator loads and shows centers
  - [ ] AI chat responds correctly
  - [ ] Admin panel accessible with new credentials
  - [ ] Navigation and routing work correctly

- [ ] **Performance Tests**
  - [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
  - [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

- [ ] **Security Tests**
  - [ ] HTTPS enforced
  - [ ] Debug routes blocked (try accessing `/debug`, `/test`)
  - [ ] Admin panel requires authentication
  - [ ] API endpoints properly secured

## üîç Health Checks

### Automated Monitoring
Set up external monitoring for:
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] Performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Error rate monitoring (Sentry)

### Manual Health Checks
- [ ] `/api/health` endpoint responds
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] External API integrations working
- [ ] Email notifications sending (if configured)

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard
   # Or redeploy previous working commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Issue Investigation**
   - Check Vercel deployment logs
   - Review Sentry error reports
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test database connectivity

3. **Fix and Redeploy**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Test locally
   - Redeploy with fixes

## üìù Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update README with production URL
  - [ ] Document any production-specific configurations
  - [ ] Update API documentation if needed

- [ ] **Team Communication**
  - [ ] Notify team of successful deployment
  - [ ] Share production URL and admin credentials
  - [ ] Schedule post-deployment review

- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**
  - [ ] Configure alert thresholds
  - [ ] Set up regular health check schedule
  - [ ] Plan first maintenance window

## üéØ Success Criteria
